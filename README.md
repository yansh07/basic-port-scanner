# Port scanner 🔌
*Tech used: Python, Nmap, whois, socket*  
--> It's a basic port scanner program that gives bunch of options like nmap scan, whois, dns, and other such options.  

## In this project, I have used below mentioned tools 🛠️:
1. Python3 version - 3.13.3
2. Python-nmap
3. Python-whois
4. dnspython
5. OS module
6. re(regular expression/regex)
7. socket
8. colorama

## Feautres 📌:
1. This code can use nmap to perform basic scan, find open ports, and operating system being used in the system. I have also used reverse-dns in it.    
2. It can used to find IP of any domain, by using "Whois" and "nslookup" like tools.  
3. I have used 'colorama' to color output in terminal.  
4. I have used regex, built-in python module, to validate IP Address and DOMAIN to make sure that IP and Domain entered by user is in correct format.
