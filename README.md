# basic-port-scanner
A basic port scanner.
In this project, I have used below mentioned tools:
1. Python3 version - 3.13.3
2. Python-nmap
3. Python-whois
4. dnspython
5. OS module
6. re(regular expression/regex)
7. socket
8. colorama
This code can use nmap to perform basic scan, find open ports, and operating system being used in the system. I have also used reverse-dns in it.
It can used to find IP of any domain, by using "Whois" and "nslookup" like tools.
I have used 'colorama' to color output in terminal.
I have used regex, built-in python module, to validate IP Address and DOMAIN to make sure that IP and Domain entered by user is in correct format.
